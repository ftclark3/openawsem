This test compares hydrogen bond energies calculated by OpenAWSEM under the "old" method, meant to mimic LAMMPS AWSEM-MD commit cea754f (https://github.com/adavtyan/awsemmd), to the energies computed by a LAMMPS binary compiled from the source at commit cea754f.

As for the other energy tests, we need for each protein *_energies.csv  *-openmmawsem.pdb, *-crystal_structure.pdb, *-crystal_structure.fasta,
*-movie.dcd, and *-ssweight. 

Since we are not checking associative memory or Debye-Huckel energies, we do not need *-single_frags.mem, *-single_frags.npy, *.gro, or *-charge.txt.

The make_test_for_* directories contain the files needed to generate the test input files: LAMMPS setup scripts, LAMMPS input files, LAMMPS trajectories, trajectories reformatted using BuildAllAtomsFromLammps_openAWSEM.py, OpenAWSEM projects giving the required crystal_structure.pdb and crystal_structure.fasta files, and LAMMPS output files (energy.log being the important one)

To make a test for a new PDB, create directory make_test_for_PDBID, put your PDB file there, change into the directory, then
conda activate openawsem310                                                                  # openawsem installation required                           
awsem_create PDBID.pdb
cp PDBID/ssweight ../PDBID-ssweight                                                          # or modify if if you don't like what openawsem did
cp PDBID/ssweight ./ssweight                                                                 # or modify if if you don't like what openawsem did
cp PDBID/crystal_structure.pdb ../PDBID-crystal_structure.pdb   
cp PDBID/crystal_structure.fasta ../PDBID-crystal_structure.fasta 
cp PDBID/PDBID-openmmawsem.pdb ../PDBID-openmmawsem.pdb

python3 ../BuildAllAtomsFromLammps_openAWSEM.py dump.lammpstrj lammps_movie.pdb PDBID.seq    # requires python=3.6.8 (other versions probably okay)
CONVERT PDB FORMAT TRAJECTORY TO DCD FORMAT (name it lammps_movie.dcd)                       # can be done easily with VMD, for example
cp lammps_movie.dcd ../PDBID-movie.dcd
TAKE THE INFORMATION FROM energy.log AND PUT IT IN ../PDBID_energies.csv, FOLLOWING THE FORMAT OF OTHER PDBID_energies.csv FILES
DON'T FORGET TO ADD PDBID TO THE PROTEINS LIST IN THE TEST SCRIPT, test_implementation_of_lammps_hbond_energies.py
